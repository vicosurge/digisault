## Chapter 1

The Historian arrives to a small town called Apacea in the middle of a large valley,
there he settles down for a few days as it is impossible to continue to the
other side due to a recent snow storm.

There is little to see on location but one interesting point is a small archive
located in the edge of town.

## Chapter 2

The Historian speaks with the Archivist and goes through the content of the small
shelves, eventually finding a book which has no proper classification and being
there for what seemed like an eternity.

Taking this book back to the Motel the Historian finds the name of the book
to be intriguing, "The Society of the Nine and the Secret History of the World".

## Chapter 3

The Historian barely sleeps as he goes through the content, fascinated and
trapped at the same time by its content. At dawn he goes to sleep and has
a flashback of some of the things he has read mixed with other things
he cannot understand.

A thriving civilization at the edge of West Africa, the Atlantean Rings
and large floating Orbs surrounding the city, a figure in a black garb with
13 glowing diamonds on its face looking back at him, an old monstery sunken
deep in the sea with something sleeping deep inside, a large figure walking
around an ancient city, crushing buildings and throwing large balls of
flames with eyes.

After waking up he proceeds to the cafe where he has an encounter.

## Chapter 4

The Shadowman has come to speak with the Historian and what seems to be
an accidental find, the Historian at this point is confused and cannot
understand what is happening but everything is frozen around.

While his mind is being digged upon the Historian remembers that he
is in an astral travel and that he can return at any given time, with this
he manages to call himself out of the dimension he is stuck in and back
into reality where he notices bleeding from his nose and mouth.
