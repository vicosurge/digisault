It is in the depths of the old ship that the tesseract sits, this old object was
part of the items forged in the forgotten high city of Zandalar.

The tesseract is a powerful object of immense power, having been used to uphold
the seasons and the link to the city of Atlantis, once the city sank the tesseract
became part of what upheld the city in secret as well as keeping what is still
known as the eternal season.

During the height of Zandalar the city was capable of sustaining a large portion
of survivors from the collapseof the ancient city, but the population brought
change that made the city unstable in the following decades.

When the city fell into disarray and the tesseract was removed from its place
the city became a freezing tomb rapidly, crops died immediately, countless died
from the sub-zero temperatures andthe survivors cursed the dividers, the Observers.

This is a reference to the Silver Tree, the Observers come from an old Atlantian
who had seen a Silver Tree during an Astral Travel in a lower dimension, this tree
is a representation of a duality which holds the dimensions together and contains
forbidden knowledge and powers that can easily tempt anyone who listens.

The collapse of the ancient city, having been started by the Tainted, was
impossible to stop regardless of the source of power or knowledge of those trying
to protect the ancient city.

The survivors of the high city took the most sacred items and moved away, a few
remained back at the city to protect the Tesseract and the Temple.

The tesseract, having lived there for thousands of years, had built an exact
copy of the high city inside of a pocket dimension built from years of handling
powerul amounts of energy.

This dimension slowly became correupted by the Observers but still contains much
of the ancient knowledge and power of the high city.

There are only two ways to access the city, one is to travel through a door to
the only building with a door, the Grand House of Etkyr, or by use of the
Tesseract and allowing it to pull you while astral travelling.

Either option is dangerous, one can kill you physically while the other one
can kill your soul. Anyone deciding to venture forth on either mode should
consider that this is basically a death wish.

Taking care of the Tesseract is possible but it should never be handled with
your own hands, they should always be covered by something natural like 
leather or the hands will be burnt with the freezing power of the Tesseract.

While the object has passed from guardian to guardian, after it was discovered
by accident by humans during an archeological travel and from there it
has been moved along all over the world while being closely watched by parties
interested in recovering it.

The last one to hold it was a Jesuit who sank with it in the SS Louisiana at
Lake Michigan, the object is still there in the ship but unseen due to the
unnatural power of the island to cover magic features/powers due to another
object interfering in the island.
