= The Berneberu
The Invisible Hand controlling everything

== Introduction
The Berneberu are an obscure and powerful race found on the other side of the
galaxy, they are the masters of many races which they have enslaved or 
transformed into their servants.

The Berneberu have lived for centuries or millenia, and for some time have
found expansion towards the portion of the galaxy in which Earth and
Humanity is located to be complicated due to a lack of existance of other
living creatures which they can use as vessels to move forward their
eternal conquest.

The Atlanteans and the Lemurians, two races that served the Berneberu,
found themselves in a long voyage to colonize and eventually open the 
gateway to the Berbeneru. But finding that they could do as they wanted and
be free from their masters they resented continuing their task and found a
way to co-exist in the beginning.

But the power of their masters would eventually catch up to them, the first
war between the Atlanteans and the Lemurians saw the Atlanteans pull power from
the Fray, a connection of all living creatures, and opened a small path for
the Berneberu to commence their reconnection and takeover of their vessels.

Initially successful in this task they found it extremely consuming to keep
attached to these hosts and the corruption from the Fray drove most of the
vessels mad and into a savege frenzy which tore the Lemurians apart.

== Apotheosis

At the time of the end, only Nine knows about the existence of the Berneberu
and their true intent. Knowing full well of their power and intentions it is
with regret that he must sink the old city of Atlantis to prevent the Gateway
from being restored and allowing them to pass true.

This event will turn into a cataclysm that will bring an end to all life on Earth
but at the same time will completely free them from what would have been eternal
serviture under the most terrifying creatures in the galaxy.
