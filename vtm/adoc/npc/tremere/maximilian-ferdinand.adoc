==== Maximilian Ferdinand of Cologne
The Primogen of the Tremere in Venice and one of the oldest Kindred in Venice, 
Maximilian had worked his way to get the title of Prince of Venice but his 
maneuvering was stopped by the Primogen and Elders of Venice who warned him 
that his rule would be as short as Prince Alberto if not shorter since he holds 
no true Political or Economical power and in the long run the Camarilla does 
not trust the Tremere enough due to their bound with their own Council.

While upset by the decision he did not question or fight it, he observes from 
the back of the current scenario to understand something more sinister that 
is happening in Venice, something that still has not come to fruition.
