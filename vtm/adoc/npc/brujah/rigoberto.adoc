==== Rigoberto di Formo
Rigoberto is one of the Captains of the Guard of Venice who works during the 
long hours of the night ensuring that the peace and serenity of the Republic 
of Venice is held in proper order, he is by nature a very fierce combatant and 
very able to crush with his own hands anything that comes his way. He went 
into Torpor for a week due to a stake on his heart and came back not knowing 
what has happened to him.

While investigating a crime committed against a ghoul belonging to the Primogen 
of the Brujah he had gathered enough evidence to loot and burn the house and 
everyone inside as ordered by the Doge of Venice, this not only has caused 
tension between Prince Odo and the Giovanni, who have temporally delivered 
Venice to Odo to enforce the Masquerade, but also between the Giovanni and 
Brujah who seem to have bought the Captain.
