==== Clemens Antonio of Mantua
Clemens is a Brujah born into conflict, his embrace performed as he was dying 
in the battlefield, his tenure as a kindred has been nothing but struggle with 
more blood than the usual Camarilla Kindred would need or want, short-tempered 
and violent at the minor provocation he fit proper into the Brujah and been 
into conflict with Ventrue due to their ill-judgement on most affairs 
concerning the safety of the Camarilla and the battle against the Sabbat. 

In Venice he has become part of the network of Arsenals of Venice where he 
works diligently for the safety of the city.
