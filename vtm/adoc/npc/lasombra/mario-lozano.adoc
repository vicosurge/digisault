==== Father Mario Lozano Matamoros
Mario is, as Odo, a Kindred who has looked upon bringing forth the salvation 
of humanity and the Kindred in general, as a Lasombra he is of doubtful 
allegiance to the Camarilla having never formally resigned the Sabbat, although 
no formal resignation can be done to begin with from such a thing.

Father Mario has known Ricardo for as long as he has been in Venice, around 100 
years, and while he has his differences with him he believes that Ricardo has a 
good heart, is a good Catholic and is not the man that he plays to be rather 
simply fills the emptiness he perceives with vices and lust.
