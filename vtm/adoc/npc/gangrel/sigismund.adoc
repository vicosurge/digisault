==== Sigismund
Sigismund is a an ancillae of the Gangrel, a noble person at heart it was a 
misfortune that was embraced by the Kindred while he was out to hunt, he is 
a victim of the Sabbat shovelhead tradition and while a survivor of the mass 
grave he was left confused and without true direction, his family suffered the 
consequences of him becoming a Kindred and were burned at the stake with 
Sigismund barely surviving the persecution that followed, from that time on 
Sigismund has become a nomad and only coming to Venice in recent years, calm 
and considerate for a Kindred, he is not looked upon kindly but some have 
mercy on him due to his unfortunate past.

By decision of Odo he was made Keeper of Elysium, while this position has 
brought him considerable power he has decided to continue serving at the doors 
of Elysium as well as pretending the title is nothing more than a new prefix 
added to his name, just to avoid it getting to him.
