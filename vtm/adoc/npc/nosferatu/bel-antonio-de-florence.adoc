==== Primogen Bel Antonio de Florence
Bel is an old Nosferatu, so old sometimes talks about Venice before the 
channels and structures were present but most tend to ignore this or call it 
off as something he has made up on his own, most Nosferatu are aware he is old 
but they also assume he is not that old to be awake and walking. Bel remembers 
Rabbat, Rabbat remembers Bel, Bel has helped her to avoid the wrath of the 
Camarilla for longer than he should have and he knows it with most Nosferatu 
beginning to suspect something about it, the Masquerade may break sooner than 
later for his indiscretion.
