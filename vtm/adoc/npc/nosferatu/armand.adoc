==== Armand
A relatively old Neonate, inside the 70 year mark, who behaves properly and 
spends his time with the Toreador, he also trades important information, at 
least for them, in regards to the events around the city and Kindred society 
in general but he also delivers important information when necessary aside 
from the usual mark.

By decision of the Seneschal and the Sheriff, Armand was assigned to a team 
of Deputies in charge of assisting with the investigation and execution of the 
Camarilla laws, he has proven to be a reliable Kindred, either by himself or 
the rats he handles, strong and intelligent although his odor caused the PC 
party to go through problems in the past.

He is also under protection by Ricardo, few know about Armands homosexual 
tendencies and some of the few who know are looking to bring him to his 
Final Death.
