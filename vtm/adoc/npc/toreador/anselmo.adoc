==== Anselmo, the Violin Maker
Embraced by Maria de Bordeaux in a fit of rage and emotions, he has been 
allowed to continue to live by permission of the Prince of Venice and has 
had Thomas Tornelli assigned as his Mentor.

Anselmo is obsessed with his line of work, he will not stop until he makes 
the perfect instrument for each and every one of his customers if he considers 
it so, it is not so much about the money that he does this for but the sound, 
the music, something enthralls him to the point of obsession and he will not 
rest until he comes up with the perfect instrument, the sublime is little to 
what he really wants.
