==== Master Antonio Marcollini
Master Marcollini is a Toreador who learned from Veroccio a few years prior to 
DaVinci becoming an apprentice of the same Master, the difference being that 
Marcollini was not interested in all the different fields that DaVinci had 
gotten into and worked to get a deeper anatomical understanding to work on 
sculptures rather than painting, throughout the centuries he worked his way 
through this and established a workshop which he keeps open to anyone who 
wishes to learn at no cost, his desire to put art in the hands of everyone has 
taken him to extreme extents from losing everything to getting in problems, 
his desire to paint and sculpt the naked body has put him also in the eye of 
the Church more than once but Odo has saved him more than once from any 
possible seizures or reprisals.
