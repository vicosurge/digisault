==== Primogen Thomas Tornelli (Toto)
Thomas Tornelli was in love with her Wife during their mortal life, they both 
performed Theater and he wrote their lines, poetry and declaimed, they were 
the perfect couple until unlife led both to the Toreador, with an eternity in 
front of them Thomas, known by most as Toto, became frustrated and pulled into 
idleness and eventually politics.

By order of the Prince he had to take the unlife of her Wife and has now become 
an embittered Primogen who has to take over what Odo left for him.
