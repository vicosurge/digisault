==== Maria de Bordeaux
Maria is a lover of music and musicians, she has met her Final Death at the 
hands of her husband, Thomas Tornelli, in 1714 by the order of the Prince of 
Venice for breaking the Third Tradition. Maria was embraced at the same time 
as her Husband, both worked performing Theater and when able Maria would sign 
Opera but the struggle to bring his Husband to stage, her inspiration, killed 
her love for him eventually and in the later years they reached an estranged 
relationship where they tolerated each other for their common bond to the Toreador.
