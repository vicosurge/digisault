==== Grigorio Giovanni
If Donatello is the enforcer of his father then Grigorio is the enforcer of 
Donatello, a brute yet smart enough to know his Kindred power are limited yet 
he abuses them when confronting anyone, he cares little for the Camarilla and 
Sabbat and makes open threats to them without understanding the real 
consequences of his actions.
