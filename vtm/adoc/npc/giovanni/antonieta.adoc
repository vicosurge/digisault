==== Antonieta Giovanni
The current jewel of the human Giovanni family, smart, charming, a patron of 
the arts, diplomatic and easy going, she is trapped most of the time in the 
family estate and looks toward freedom through any means, even if it means 
receiving the Embrace. She has already received the Proxy Kiss and is well 
versed in Kindred terminology, she is not an avid practitioner of the 
Necromantic tradition of the family but is able to perform better than most of 
the Human side of the family.

By order of the Kindred side of the family she is never to be touched in any 
way or form and to be given a certain degree of freedom from other Giovanni 
affairs that do not yet concern her. A lover of music she is fascinated about 
having found a young musician, a PC Toreador, who has melted her heart and has 
gone as far as to declare her love to him in a subtle way and convinced her 
Father to allow him to play for them inside the estate.
