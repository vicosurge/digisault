==== Donatello Giovanni
The next in line for the position of paterfamilias, as ruthless if not more 
than his father but an agile mind and enough contacts to make him the right 
choice, he has an incestuous relation with her Aunt and has produced three 
offspring from this relationship, she is as ruthless as him but has more 
tact and is better at diplomatic conversations.

As his father he has an obsession with his sisters and lusts for Antonieta 
with passion, the only reason he has not made a move is because he does not 
wish to bring the wrath of the Kindred side of the family onto himself.
