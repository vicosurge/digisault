==== Former Prince Alberto
The Former Prince Alberto loved to live in excess and with everything always 
pointing towards him, be it good or bad. While in Paris he lived through the 
court unnoticed, considered a buffoon, incapable of political or economic 
ambition, too self-centered to even care about doing anything other than 
praise himself.

This made him an easy puppet or so most thought until placed by the court of 
Paris in the chair of Venice, it is widely believed that the reason why the 
Camarilla has not been able to place itself in power inside Venice was because 
of the former Prince, also the fact that the court of Venice had to pay tribute 
to the Giovanni caused an outrageous response from other courts Europe.

His final death came to him whilst court was in session, an assassin came to 
him and ensured that the Sun met his final death.
