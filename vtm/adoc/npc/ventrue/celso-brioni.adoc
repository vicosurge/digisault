==== Celso Brioni
Celso is a Ventrue that held a considerable control of the sales of strong 
liquors (spirits) in Venice and the surrounding areas, his immediate departure 
from Venice drew suspicions from the Primogen and an investigation was carried 
on by request by the Sheriff, Deputies found in his house a fair collection of 
items for the Occult and a summoning circle with a relatively fresh Human body 
inside which could tentatively be the body of a Garrou since they found a 
pendant with a Garrou fang.
