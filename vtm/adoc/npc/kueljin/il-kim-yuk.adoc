== Il-Kim-Yuk

The mysterious figure known as Il-Kim-Yuk comes from the far east, moving through
Otoman lands with ease with an uneasy pressence that drives Kindred and others
to quick suspicion.

Almost a ghost, with a porcelain skin that shines under the light of the moon,
and with the potential to walk under the sun it is no wonder that Kindred find
these "eastern Kindred" to be very deadly and untrustworthy.

While visiting Venice it was through their request that Selina of Agincourt
should be delivered on a silver plate to it, having offended them with their
pressence in court.

The Ventrue did not hesitate to comply and with this Il-Kim-Yuk knew that it
would be with relative ease that they could continue to influence the European
Kindred with ease.
