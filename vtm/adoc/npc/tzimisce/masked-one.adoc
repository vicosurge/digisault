==== The Masked One
There is a Tzimisce that has come to Venice, for the carnival and probably to 
search for something else, Ricardo had the misfortune to find him while 
travelling with a Tremere in his group and feared for the life of fellow 
Kindred, not for himself, although this Tzimisce seems to be part of the 
older section of his clan.

The Masked One has changed beyond human form, he is more an insect, with four 
mantis like claw spewing from his back, feet with three large toe front and 
back, visible chest with bones over the muscles and what look like wings on 
his back, the face is completely white and resembles one of the masks so 
popular in the carnival that most would dismiss immediately, to cover he 
wears a body cape and a hat.
